 *The program will calculate loan information from user input. 
 *The user will enter the loan amount, the length of the loan 
 *in years, and the annual interest rate for the loan. The 
 *program will output the interest rate incremented by 0.25, 
 *but only up to twice the original rate. Based on the 
 *incremented interest rate, the program will also output 
 *a monthly payment and the total for the loan based on the
 *loan duration.
